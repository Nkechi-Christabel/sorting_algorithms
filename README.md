## Description
- In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.
- Big O Notation in Data Structure is used to express algorithmic complexity using algebraic terms. It describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime and calculates the time and amount of memory needed to execute the algorithm for aninput value.

## Requirements

## General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` `-pedantic` `-std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, … is totally forbidden.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `sort.h`
	_Don’t forget to push your header file_
- All your header files should be include guarded
- A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
